        NASCAR's concept was formed by <q>William France, Sr., on February 21, 1948 with the help of several other drivers of the time. The points system was written on a bar room napkin.</q>

        so yeah William France Sr. (Bill) formed NASCAR's rules and the first race was at <a href="http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/">Daytona</a> in 1948.
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Petty">Lee Petty</a> won the first Daytona 500, what an honor that must have been, not only to win the first race, but to be a Petty.

Why NASCAR is so popular
<hr>
        <p>
        while researching this I came across a YAHOO answers website, the question... <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081110215800AAtqcEz">Why is NASCAR so popular?</a>
        the person who asked the question stated <q>

It's 40 guys turning left for hours at a time, am I missing something here?</q>
and a couple years ago I would have said the same thing, until I ran across a comment that sums up NASCAR      </p>
<ol type="I">
<li><q>First, it's superstars are accessible to the fans. Richard Petty won seven NASCAR championships and 200 races, 95 more than the second-leading driver David Pearson. He made it a point to sign every autograph after a race no matter how long it took him. Drivers have followed his example. This is unparalleled in sports. I doubt A Rod, Kobe Bryant or Randy Moss spend as much time courting their sports fans as do Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt and Tony Stewart.</q> </li>
<li><q>Secondly, it's the strategy and nuances of the sport. The person who doesn't know American football finds it hard to see the facets and nuances of the game. Cut and dry as it sounds, football is simply where you either hand off to a back or pass the ball to a receiver on offense and tackle on defense. You and I know there is a lot more too it. </q></li>
<li><q>Thirdly, the skill of the drivers and race teams. Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races this decade on the F1 tour. In his first year in NASCAR, last year, he had one win, three top 5s and six top 10s and finished 20th in the season standings. This year, he has no wins, two top 5s and three top 10s and is 25th in the standings. It isn't because he is a bad driver or has bad equipment -- he drives for the primary car in Chip Ganassi Racing. It's because the drivers and race teams are really good throughout the NASCAR field.</q></li>
