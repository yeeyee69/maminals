Racisism is a lot worse than you may think. Although I know that other countires have racisim that are a lot more prevalant and more extreme in other countries, it is still sad that exists. <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-bad-is-racism-in-America"><span id="racist_article">here's an article describing it</span></a>

<li>Americans are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html">Obese</a>  AF</li>

did you know that 30% of Americans are obese, that's a lot, with there being 329,002,327 people in America as of June 18, 2019, that would mean 98,700,698 of people are obese
</p>
