    There are 8 planets in our solar system, they are <a href="https://space-facts.com/mercury/" id="merc">Mercury,</a> <a href="https://space-facts.com/venus/" id="veen">Venus,</a> <a href="https://space-facts.com/earth/" id="e">Earth,</a> Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
Planets in our solar system can be divided into two main groups, Terrestrial Planets and Gas Giants. Planets that orbit other stars are referred to as Exoplanets.

   <strong> Mercury’s </strong>craters are named after famous artists, musicians and authors.<br>
<strong>Venus</strong> is the hottest planet in the solar system.<br>
<strong>Earth’s</strong> atmosphere protects us from meteoroids and radiation from the Sun.<br>
There have been more missions to Mars than any other planet.<br>
<strong>Jupiter</strong> has more than double the mass of all the other planets combined.<br>
<strong>Saturn</strong> has more moons than any other planet in the Solar System.<br>
<strong>Uranus</strong> has only been visited by a single spacecraft, Voyager 2.<br>
It takes like more than 4 hours for light to reach Neptune from the Sun.
Only 8 planets have been discovered in our solar system but there is compelling evidence for a <strong>9th</strong> planet.
With the exception of Neptune and Uranus the other 6 planets can be seen unaided and all 8 are visible with a small telescope or binoculars.
Together the planets make up 0.14% of the solar systems mass, 99% of which is the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).
Except for the Earth, the planets are named after gods from Roman and Greek mythology.

<!--insert div-bacground-blue-table here-->
<br>
<p>
*The order of the planets from closest to the Sun outwards is; Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and finally Neptune.<br>
*The largest planet in the solar system is Jupiter, followed by Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Earth, Venus, Mars with the smallest being Mercury.<br>
The table below shows the size of the planet, how far it is from the Sun and how long it takes to complete a single orbit.

<div id="div-grey">
A planet is a celestial body that<br><br>
A. is in orbit around the Sun,<br>
B. has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape,<br> C. and
has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.
</div>
<p>
Under this definition, <a href="https://space-facts.com/pluto/" id="pluto">Pluto</a> is NOT a planet, but has been deemed a dwarf planet because it has not yet cleared its orbit. This definition is under discussion, particularly by members of the planetary science community, and it may yet be further refined.
