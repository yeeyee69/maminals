   Why leaves change color
   </h1>
   <div>
   <h3>
   It is known that leaves change color, proof...<br> look outside for a year, youll see they change colors, but why. 
   </h3>
   <p>
   It all has to do with photosynthisis, and here is how this process works.<br> <q>Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through<br> their roots. They take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use<br> sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. Oxygen is a <br>gas in the air that we need to breathe. Glucose is a kind of sugar. Plants use <br>glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing.</q>

   <div>
   <p>
   as the days in winter get shorter the plants know to stock up on all remaining food and the chlorophyll disappears because they can't produce food
