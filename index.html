   <strong> Mercury’s </strong>craters are named after famous artists, musicians and authors.<br>
<strong>Venus</strong> is the hottest planet in the solar system.<br>
<strong>Earth’s</strong> atmosphere protects us from meteoroids and radiation from the Sun.<br>
There have been more missions to Mars than any other planet.<br>
<strong>Jupiter</strong> has more than double the mass of all the other planets combined.<br>
<strong>Saturn</strong> has more moons than any other planet in the Solar System.<br>
<strong>Uranus</strong> has only been visited by a single spacecraft, Voyager 2.<br>
It takes like more than 4 hours for light to reach Neptune from the Sun.
Only 8 planets have been discovered in our solar system but there is compelling evidence for a <strong>9th</strong> planet.
With the exception of Neptune and Uranus the other 6 planets can be seen unaided and all 8 are visible with a small telescope or binoculars.
Together the planets make up 0.14% of the solar systems mass, 99% of which is the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).
Except for the Earth, the planets are named after gods from Roman and Greek mythology.
